# My DotFiles

Currently only available/known to be working on MacOS. If I ever set up a
linux environment, then I will ensure cross-platform support/setup!

## Themes and Fonts

I use the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme for almost
everything (though I have modified some of the background colors since I like
it a bit darker). For fonts, I love the
[DinaRemasterII](https://github.com/zshoals/Dina-Font-TTF-Remastered), but
unfortunately there is not a NerdFont patch (maybe can do at some point?).
Currently using Iosevka because it seems pretty clean and standard. Used
Wezterm and liked the lua config, but trying out ghostty because why not.
Alacritty not my favorite due to lack of font-fallback.

## Applications
- ghostty
- gpg
- htop
- neovim
- Keepassxc
- rsync (on linux)
- tmux
- virtualenv
- zsh

### mail
Currently using neomutt for my email. Using (my) [mutt-wizard](https://github.com/matthew-hennefarth/mutt-wizard) as my setup.
Coupling of things to note:
- might need to do some cleanup of the config files (in the home directory)

## Todo

- [ ] Update tmux status weather to cache results
- [ ] clean-up tmux-status configuration into better scripts...
