# My DotFiles

Currently only available/known to be working on MacOS. If I ever set up a
linux environment, then I will ensure cross-platform support/setup!

## Themese and Fonts

I use the gruvbox theme for almost everything. For fonts, I switch between
DinaRemasterII and Terminess Nerd Font.

## Applications
- alacritty
- gpg
- htop
- neovim
- newsboat
- pass
- tmux
- virtualenv
- zsh

## mail
Currently using neomutt for my email. Using (my) [mutt-wizard](https://github.com/matthew-hennefarth/mutt-wizard) as my setup.
Coupling of things to note:
- might need to do some cleanup of the config files (in the home directory)
- need to get python3 markdown package (will include in the requirements.txt at
  some point)
